Since I am busy with a few different projects, when time permits, I will
update and test the OpenCataclysm Development Server. So any updates or
database changes that are made, will be tested the best I can first before
I will include them in github!

Please check the OpenCataclysm Forums from time to time as DB updates will
more than likely be posted there as it's easier to release them!
